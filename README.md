Title: Student Result Management System
1. Reasons for choosing the topic:
There are many aspects as to why a Student Result Management System needs to be developed
and the basic factor is that students find it so hard even in obtaining and confirming results.
The existing situation in terms of checking the various results is that a lot of them depend on
other forms of paper based documentation and traditional menial work or the internet in
different files but different formats. And then came the idea of verification, which has led to
making it a must that one should bring his or her identity card to be checked and signed for,
which makes it in a way tetragonal as it involves as much time spent and at times inconvenient
spatially especially during busy period such as days when results are out from heavy
examination sessions.
Some of those factors prompted the present project. In this respect, this document sets to study
a common and safe way of accessing the views of results uploaded by persons who, in most
cases, are this release of confidential information, known to only few and some without the
risk of them being exposed. This is in line with today’s learning where the majority of
administrative tasks and information access is rapidly being moved to the internet.
2. Goal of the Project:
The main goal of this particular project is to come up with an appropriate online portal for
student result management which is secure and easy to use. The system should enable the
faculty to update student results with ease and also allow students to have a secure area where
they can view and confirm their scores. The specific objectives are as follows:
• Single Point Access – Providing the students with separate results which they are able to
access without having to peruse through many systems.
• Access Restriction – Providing measures that will ensure students will only access their
results and not anybody else’s in a bid to safeguard such academic information.
• Mark Verification from a Distance – In consideration of the students, they will be able to
access their marks through the internet without travelling which is a less costly and time
wasting exercise for the students and the faculty.
• Quick Inserts – Allowing the teaching staff to enter or correct students’ results within a short
period of time thereby reducing the time taken to disseminate the final results to the concerned
parties.
3. Customer Segment
The focus customer segment for this system is:
1. Educational Institutions: This category comprises schools, colleges, universities,
training centers and other types of centres that need a computerized system to help in
the distribution and verification processes of student results.
2. Support and Teaching Staff: The teaching staff in charge of monitoring and entering
marks, as well as an administrative officer tasked with reconciling the results with the
expected deliveries resulting from the processes.
3. Students: They are the system’s end users. They would be able to login and check their
results through this web portal, which is secure and user friendly with easy navigation.
4. Parents and Guardians (if applicable): If such parents are allowed to use the system,
then they will be able to log in and view their children’s results without any security
threats.
4. Project Overview:
 The Student Result Management System is an overall web application, which targets
educational institutions and the relevant stakeholders to effectively and securely manage
results. This has a front-end for students as well as a back-end for faculty/administrators.
This is a full stack project in which a secure database is integrated to store and manage
the result data, a responsive frontend for access purposes and administrative controls for
entry and updates of data.
 Key Features of the System:
 Role Based Access: Faculty and students are assigned different access levels in order
ensure that information is accessed only by the persons intended and also in order to
keep data secure and private.
 User Friendly Interface: System Interface is simple and easy to use; it is also easy to
reach many users as it can be operated on any type of device.
 Result Verification Mechanism: The portal provides students with an option to see their
marks and confirm it. Such a feature eliminates the need of students physically coming
to the institution therefore reducing administrative costs.
 Audit Trail: All the changes made in the system and verification done are recorded so
that the institutions are able to track back their activities when necessary.
 Technical Implementation
 In Figma React.js is chosen and applied for an interactive and responsive front-end user
interface. Node.js is used for server operations whilst MongoDB is used for data storage
of results in a safe manner. This makes all technologies used scalable, secure and
performance based for a smooth experience of all the stakeholders involved. •
 It would fill the gap between faculty and students, improve the administrative efficiency,
and provide a hassle-free experience to all the parties involved in the complete process.
